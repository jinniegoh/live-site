          <h1>About Ipoh</h1>
          <h3> Recognized by LonelyPlanet to be one of the best places for retirement, Ipoh is a lovely town that is rich for its history and gastronomic delights. Best known for its food, most tourists stop by and stay a day or two to fill themselves up here. The easiest way to tell which store would be best, "the dodgier the restaurant, the better it is!" </h3>

                The steamed chicken skin is smooth and chewy, while the flesh is tender yet firm; whereas the bean sprouts are fat and crunchy. You can choose to have them with rice, or sweet and fresh kuey teow soup.</h4>
